" Pathogen no longer used
" Native plugin manager:
"    ~/.vim/pack/<collection>/start/ content is autoloaded
"    ~/.vim/pack/<collection>/opt/ content can be loaded with `:packadd packagename`
" (Pathogen was installed by putting it in ~/.vim/autoload)
" infect() defaults to 'bundle' but another folder can be used here, or even supply multiple folders
"execute pathogen#infect()      

" Installed plugins (loaded after this vimrc?)
" - sensible => good default settings
" - sleuth => read appropriate indent settings per project
" - vim-airline => nice status bar
